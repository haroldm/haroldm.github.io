These challenges makes a good break-in into the EVM smart-contract auditing world. With this write-up I hope to provide some insight about the challenges bugs. I also want to highlight some quirks and oddities about the dev environments and frameworks.
The challenges have been updated and 4 levels have been added in November 2021: this write-up is about the updated version, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have no problem about copy-pasting solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
